# Wayland Scanner

## Unstable! Insane! Inane!

A crazy person's experimental re-implementation of the official Wayland scanner.

A self-serving thought experiment about tool/language diversification.

* How is this implementation better and worse than _scanner.c_?
* Separation of data (eg inline strings used for codegen) from code better?
* Can external templates facilitate multi-language output?
* Can a different language and library facilitate lean code?
* Will lean code and another language ecosystem enable easier-to-maintain testing?
* Am I a crazy idiot?

TODO: Demonstrate the answers to the above.
